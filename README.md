## USE OF OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPTS IN GAME
Object-oriented concepts were used extensively in the development of the game "Mystery Hostel Game" to organize and structure the codebase:
1. Classes and Objects: Objects were used to represent various entities in the game, such as the player, rooms, items, and puzzles. Each entity had its own class with defined properties and behaviors. 

2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation was applied by bundling related data and methods within each class. For example, the Room class encapsulated information about a specific room, including its description and possible actions.

3. Abstraction: Abstraction was employed by defining classes that represented higher-level concepts and interactions in the game. For example, the Room class provided an abstraction for a room with its description and actions.

4. Modularity: The code was modular by separating different aspects of the game into their respective classes. Each class handled a specific functionality, such as rooms, puzzles, and actions. This promotes code organization and reusability.

5. Composition: Composition was used to create complex objects by combining simpler objects or components. For example, a Room object contain references to other objects such as items or puzzles.

6. Association: Association between objects was implied through their interactions. For instance, a Room object may have associations with items or actions available within that room.

7. Dependency: Dependencies were present between objects, where the behavior of one object depended on the state or actions of another object. For example, the player's interaction with a puzzle object depended on the current state of the puzzle.

Overall, there were clear indications of encapsulation, modularity, and the use of objects to represent entities in the game. By utilizing these object-oriented concepts,  "Mystery Hostel Game" we have created a structured and organized codebase that promotes code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility in implementing and expanding the game's features.
## USE OF LINKED LISTS IN THE GAME
In the context of the game "Mystery Hostel," linked lists used to represent interconnected rooms or areas within the hostel. Here's how linked lists play a role in the game:

1. Navigation and Movement: Each room or area in the hostel be represented as a node in a linked list. The linked list define the sequential order or layout of the rooms, allowing the player to navigate through the hostel by moving from one room to another. The linked list structure maintain the connections between rooms and provide a systematic way for the player to explore the game world.

2. Room Exits and Connections: Each node in the linked list contain information about the room it represents, such as its name, description, and any items or puzzles present. Additionally, each node have references to the next and previous nodes in the linked list, representing the connections between adjacent rooms. This allows the player to move forward or backward through the hostel by traversing the linked list accordingly.

3. Dynamic Room Generation: Linked lists also used to dynamically generate the hostel layout during gameplay. Rather than predefining a fixed sequence of rooms, the linked list structure enables procedural generation of the hostel, where rooms and connections can be added or removed dynamically based on certain conditions or events. This adds variability and replayability to the game as the hostel layout can change with each playthrough.

4. Puzzle Progression: Linked lists utilized to enforce a specific order or progression of puzzles within the game. Each puzzle could be associated with a room represented by a node in the linked list. The player would need to solve puzzles in a sequential order, moving from one room (node) to another, to progress through the game. The linked list structure ensures that puzzles are encountered and solved in the intended sequence.

5. Backtracking and Undoing Actions: The previous nodes in the linked list leveraged to facilitate backtracking and undoing actions within the game. If the player makes a wrong decision or wants to retrace their steps, they can traverse the linked list backward, moving to the previous room (node) in the sequence. This allows the player to revisit previously explored areas or undo certain actions, enhancing the gameplay experience.
